 abstract = {This article explores facets of effective collaboration between a librarian and a professor in the education field at a master's-level public institution. When we reflected on what made (and continues to make) our collaboration work, we discovered what actions and approaches proved most critical. Accordingly, we frame what helped us collectively become more literate around four pieces of advice: (1) Move what you offer closer to end users and make it “just right”; (2) unite around similar purpose; (3) create wins for all; and (4) leave them wanting more.},
