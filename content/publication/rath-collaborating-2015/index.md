abstract: "This article explores facets of effective collaboration between a librarian
  and a professor in the education field at a master's-level public institution. When
  we reflected on what made (and continues to make) our collaboration work, we discovered
  what actions and approaches proved most critical. Accordingly, we frame what helped
  us collectively become more literate around four pieces of advice: (1) Move what
  you offer closer to end users and make it “just right”; (2) unite around similar
  purpose; (3) create wins for all; and (4) leave them wanting more."
